### How does it work?

The user can open any .mp3/.wav audio file from any device to listen to the track.

- Every track usually contains inside all the important properties (artist name, song title, album cover). 
- With the help of Jsmediatags library, the app will retrieve from any file (if found) these pieces of information and show them on screen.
- If this data is not found, the user will be informed with an"N/A" label. This means that the track does not contain these properties and they won't be shown.
